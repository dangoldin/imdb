# IMDB Stats

This repo contains a series of queries and scripts to analyze IMDB data. The data was initially pulled via [http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/](IMDbPY) and then loaded into both MySQL and MonetDB. The queries contain ways to migrate from one to the other as well as the R scripts necessary to load and visualize the resulting CSV files.
